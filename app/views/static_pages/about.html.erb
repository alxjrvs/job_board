					<h3>Why OddJobble?</h3>
				<p>There is no doubt life is expensive.  This is even more true for college students.  We're never sure when we will have an assignemnt, an exam, or an event coming up, making it very diffucult to hold a steady job. If we do take a part-time job it usually involves some menial work that doesn't require us to use our individual skills.  That is why I created this service.</b></p>
